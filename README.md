## Project Overview

This project presents the development of a mixed reality (MR) application designed to immerse users in a dynamic warzone scenario, commemorating the victory over LTTE. The AR experience simulates a high-intensity battlefield where a soldier jumps from a helicopter to intercept a moving armored jeep, surrounded by tanks and a BRDM.

Using marker-based technology, the application integrates 3D animated models rendered in real time through a mobile webcam, offering an interactive and realistic augmented reality experience.

---

## Scenario

The chosen AR scenery is a battlefield designed for immersive experience with the following features:

- A helicopter rotating in a fixed position
- Soldiers jumping from the helicopter
- A moving armored jeep, two tanks, and a BRDM (armored reconnaissance vehicle)
- Animated elements with synchronized sound effects
- A thematic warzone background for realism

---

## Development Process

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Google Chrome / Safari (for testing)

### Technologies

- A-Frame
- AR.js
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- GLB (GL Transmission Format for 3D models)

### Steps Followed

1. **Marker Setup**  
   - Used the HIRO marker from AR.js for tracking.

2. **Model Integration**  
   - Imported `.glb` models and positioned/scaled them properly.

3. **Animations**  
   - Added movement to tanks, jeep, BRDM, helicopter, and jump animation for the soldier.

4. **Sound Integration**  
   - Used `<a-sound>` component for spatial, looping sound effects.

5. **Background Layout**  
   - Added textures, rocks, and trees to enhance scene depth.

6. **Testing and Deployment**  
   - Hosted using `ws`, tested via webcam and marker placement.

## Implementation

**Folder Structure:**

```
/Mixed-Reality
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/          # Textures, sound effects
   â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # GLB models for all 3D assets
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML file with A-Frame scene
```

To run the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shashin99/Mixed-Reality.git
cd Mixed-Reality
npm install -g ws
ws
# Visit http://localhost:8000 and use webcam with HIRO marker
```

## Creative Features

- **Animations**  
  Real-time animations include rotating helicopters, moving vehicles, and jumping soldiers.

- **Sound Integration**  
  Each object is paired with a spatial sound: engine hums, helicopter blades, battle noise.

- **Realistic Scene Composition**  
  Models are scaled and placed accurately with immersive layout and environment models.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the power of marker-based AR using A-Frame and AR.js. It merges dynamic animations, immersive sound, and interactive features to simulate a warzone. Through this, we gained hands-on experience in:

- Web-based AR development
- 3D model manipulation
- Animation and sound integration
- Marker tracking and camera testing

The final result is a real-time, browser-based AR experience that is both educational and immersive.
